<p><em>The Taj Mahal was commissioned by Shah Jahan in 1631, to be built in the memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal, a Persian princess who died giving birth to their 14th child, Gauhara Begum.
 Construction of the Taj Mahal began in 1632. 
 The imperial court documenting Shah Jahan's grief after the death of Mumtaz Mahal illustrate the love story held as the inspiration for Taj Mahal.
 The principal mausoleum was completed in 1643 and the surrounding buildings and garden were finished about five years later.</em></p>
